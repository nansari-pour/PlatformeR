# PlatformeR

An In silico whole-genome sequencing (WGS) copy number aberrations (CNA) simulator

## About

This R package is an in silico genomics tool designed to generate WGS-based alignment files (BAM) with simulated CNA. This tool is intended to assist researchers in testing hypotheses and benchmarking CNA tools using simulated data.

PlatformeR is designed for efficient performance, typically completing per-chromosome simulations in less than 6 hours with 8 cores, ensuring fast generation of simulated WGS data.

## Installation

To install the package, you can use the `devtools` library in R (>3.0.2):

```R
# Install devtools if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
```
### Install your package from GitHub

```R
devtools::install_github("nansari-pour/PlatformeR")
```
### Dependencies

PlatformeR has been carefully designed so that it has no dependencies on other R packages.
However, it requires the following external tools for its functionality:

[samtools](http://www.htslib.org/) for handling SAM and BAM files (v1.17 tested)

[bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) for generating alignment BAM files from FASTQ files (v0.7.17 tested)

[art](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art) for generating FASTQ files based on the FASTA files generated by PlatformeR (version 2016.06.05 tested)



## Usage

### Running Simulations

The package includes Bash scripts which submit and run PlatformeR for simulating data and running jobs on both SLURM and SGE systems. The Bash (and respective R) scripts are located in the `inst/scripts` directory.

#### SLURM SYSTEM

To submit a job on a SLURM system, use the following command:

```bash
sbatch --partition=YOUR_SYSTEM_PARTITION_NAME --ntasks=8 --mem=40G --time=0-06:00:00 -a 1-22 ./PlatformeR.sh
```
Replace YOUR_SYSTEM_PARTITION_NAME with the appropriate SLURM partition.

Note: Adjust the SLURM parameters based on your system's specifications but bear in mind larger chromosomes will need ~40G of mem and around 5-6 hours to complete.

#### SGE SYSTEM

To submit a job on an SGE system, use the following command (not tested):

```bash
qsub -q YOUR_SYSTEM_QUEUE_NAME -pe shmem 8 -l h_rt=6:00:00,h_vmem=40G -t 1-22 ./PlatformeR.sh
```
Replace YOUR_SYSTEM_QUEUE_NAME with the appropriate SGE queue.

Note: Adjust the SGE parameters based on your system's specifications but bear in mind larger chromosomes will need ~40G of mem and around 5-6 hours to complete.

## FAQ

#### Q: Why is the tool called "PlatformeR"?

A: I have always been a big fan of platformer games and the the more I saw genome-wide copy number plots, it looked more like the landscape of a platformer game, with the copy number aberrations resembling a platformed terrain. Hence, the name "PlatformeR" was chosen as a playful homage to platformer games.

#### Q: How can I contribute to PlatformeR development?

A: Contributions to PlatformeR are welcome! If you have ideas for new features, bug fixes, or improvements, please raise an issue or submit a pull request detailing the changes you've made and why they should be merged.
Your contributions will be reviewed, and feedback may be provided before merging. Thank you for helping improve PlatformeR!
